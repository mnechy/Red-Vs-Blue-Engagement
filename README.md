# Red-Vs-Blue-Engagement

This project was completed as a student of an Arizona State University Cybersecurity course.  The project consisted of a Windows virtual machine and three Linux virtual machines set in an Azure environment. The completion of this project demonstrates the exploitation of cyber vulnerabilities to a fictional company's cyber resources, gaining access to privileged information, in addition to reviewing SIEM logs for detection. A Kali Linux machine was used for the Penetration Testing, and an ELK SIEM was used in order to analyze the attack.
